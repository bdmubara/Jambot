[Verse1]
Hey Jude
Don't make it Bad
take a sad song
and make it better
rememeber to let her into your heart
then you can start 
to make it better
[Chorus1]
and anytime you feel the pain
hey jude refrain
don't carry the weight
upon your shoulders
For well you know that its a fool
who plays it cool
by making his world a little colder
[Chorus2]
So let it out and let it in
Hey jude begin 
you're waiting 
for someone to 
perform with
and don't you know that its just you
hey jude you'll do
the movement you need 
is on your shoulder
