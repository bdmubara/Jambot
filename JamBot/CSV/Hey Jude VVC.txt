[Verse1]
Hey Jude
Don't be afraid
you made to 
and make it better
rememeber to let her into your heart
then you can start 
to make it better
[Verse2]
Hey Jude 
don't be afraid
You were to 
go out and get her
the minute you let under your skin
then you begin
to make it better
[Chorus1]
and anytime you feel the pain
hey jude refrain
don't carry the weight
upon your shoulders
For well you know that its a fool
who plays it cool
by making his world a little colder
